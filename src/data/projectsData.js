    writeup: `Leafwear — Sustainable Fashion E-Commerce UI/UX Design (Figma)

I designed Leafwear, a sustainable fashion e-commerce website, as a high-fidelity interactive prototype in Figma. The goal was to create a visually striking yet easy-to-use shopping experience that reflects eco-friendly values while guiding users smoothly from browsing to checkout.

The project includes a full desktop and mobile user flow, showing how customers discover products, view item details, add them to their cart, and navigate through the site.

High-Fidelity Desktop & Mobile Design

I created five distinct desktop pages, including:
• Home
• Product browsing
• Product details
• Cart
• About / Contact

These screens demonstrate a complete e-commerce flow, allowing users to move naturally through the website as if it were a real store. I also designed a mobile version of the homepage, translating the layout into a responsive format while maintaining clarity and usability.

Interactions, Animations & Prototyping

To make the prototype feel realistic and interactive, I implemented:
• On-click, on-hover, and on-tap triggers
• Smart Animate, slide transitions, and dissolve effects
• Scrollable sections that simulate real website behaviour

These interactions allow users to move between products, open item pages, and navigate menus just like in a real shopping platform.

Variables & Conditional Logic

I used Figma variables and conditionals to simulate dynamic content, such as:
• Login vs logged-out states
• Changing button labels
• Showing or hiding elements based on user actions

This makes the prototype behave like a real web application rather than just static screens.

Visual Identity & UX Thinking

Leafwear uses a leaf-inspired visual theme with a cyber-green colour palette to communicate sustainability and modern fashion. I designed all UI elements—buttons, cards, navigation, and product layouts—to be consistent and visually clear across all screens.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
• Design full e-commerce user flows
• Apply UI/UX principles
• Use advanced Figma prototyping features
• Create polished, professional interfaces`

    writeup: `Jaizz Sauce Pizza – React App

I built a fun and interactive pizza store web app using React as part of a mid-semester assignment. The app allows users to browse pizzas, search in real time, and mark their favourite pizzas using an interactive star system.

The application is structured using reusable React components and uses state and props to handle live search, favourite toggling, and time-based store status (open or closed). These features helped me practise core React concepts such as state management, conditional rendering, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

This project strengthened my fundamentals in React and showed my ability to build engaging, user-friendly interfaces with clean component structure.

Key Features

One of the main features I implemented was a live search system. As the user types into the search bar, the pizza list updates instantly. This was done by storing the search query in React state and filtering the pizza data dynamically.

I also added a favourite system, where users can click a star icon on any pizza to mark it as a favourite. This taught me how to:

• Store user selections in state
• Toggle values
• Pass functions and data between components

Another feature I implemented was time-based logic. The footer checks the user's current time and displays whether the store is open or closed, which makes the app feel more realistic.

To keep the project fun, I added humorous "evil" elements—such as fake "out of stock" alerts—showing that I can combine technical functionality with personality and creative UI design.

Component Structure

The application displays a list of pizzas using a card-based layout, where each pizza shows:

• An image
• A name
• A description
• A price

I structured the UI into reusable React components such as:

• Header – Displays the brand name and tagline
• Pizza – A reusable pizza card component
• Search Bar – Allows users to filter pizzas in real time
• Footer – Shows whether the store is open and includes an interactive button

This helped me understand how to separate logic and UI cleanly across different components.`

    writeup: `Learn@RP – Mobile Learning App UI Kit & Prototype (Figma)

I designed Learn@RP, a mobile learning app for RP students, as a high-fidelity Figma prototype focused on usability, consistency, and real-world interaction. The goal was to help students learn new skills on the go through short lessons, structured courses, and clear progress tracking.

A major focus of this project was building a fully custom UI Kit from scratch and applying it across all app screens to ensure visual and functional consistency.

Custom UI Kit

I created a complete UI system that includes:

• Typography styles and colour palette
• Buttons, icons, and navigation elements
• Cards, grids, and layout components
• Input fields, dialogs, and form elements
• Media elements such as thumbnails and avatars
• Interactive components like loading spinners and toggles

All screens in the app are built using this kit, making the design scalable and consistent.

High-Fidelity App Screens

Using my UI kit, I designed the core pages of the app:

• Home page – shows learning progress and recommended content
• Course List page – displays available courses in a scrollable layout
• Lesson Details page – shows lesson content and progress

These screens form a complete learning flow from discovery to completion.

Advanced Interactions & Micro-Interactions

I implemented realistic app behaviours, including:

• Horizontal scrolling for course lists
• Overlays for menus and pop-ups
• Toggle switches for settings and states
• Loading spinners to simulate data fetching

I even built a working text input field inside Figma, demonstrating advanced use of variables and component states to simulate real user input.

What This Project Shows

This project demonstrates my ability to:

• Build a full UI design system
• Design realistic, interactive prototypes
• Apply UX principles to learning platforms
• Create scalable, professional mobile app designs

Learn@RP highlights both my UI/UX design skills and my ability to think like a product designer, not just a visual designer.`
